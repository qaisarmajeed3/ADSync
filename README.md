# Introduction 
The Active Directory User Sync to MongoDB Utility is a C# program designed to synchronize user data from an Active Directory (AD) server to a local MongoDB database. This utility simplifies the process of extracting user information from Active Directory and storing it in a MongoDB database for various use cases, such as application integration, reporting, or user management.

#Feature
Active Directory Data Retrieval: Retrieve user data from an Active Directory server, including attributes like username, email, first name, last name, and more.

MongoDB Integration: Store user data in a local MongoDB database, providing a NoSQL data store for efficient retrieval and querying.

Scheduled Sync: The utility can be configured to run on a schedule, ensuring that user data in the MongoDB database stays up to date with changes in the Active Directory.

Customizable Mapping: Define a custom mapping between Active Directory attributes and MongoDB document fields to suit your specific data requirements.

Logging and Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and error handling to facilitate debugging and monitoring of synchronization processes.
